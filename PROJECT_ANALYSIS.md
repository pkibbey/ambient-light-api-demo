## Summary
This project is a demonstration of the HTML5 Ambient Light API, showcasing how web applications can detect and respond to changes in ambient light levels. It serves as an educational tool for developers learning about HTML5 sensor APIs and provides a simple, interactive example of adaptive web design based on environmental conditions.

## Key Features
• **Real-time ambient light detection** - Uses the HTML5 DeviceLightEvent API to monitor lux levels
• **Dynamic theme switching** - Automatically adjusts page styling (dark, mid, light themes) based on detected light levels
• **Browser compatibility detection** - Checks for API support and displays appropriate messages
• **Live lux value display** - Shows current ambient light measurements in real-time
• **Responsive visual feedback** - Smooth transitions between different lighting themes with color and opacity changes

## Technical Stack
• **HTML5** - Core markup and Ambient Light API integration
• **JavaScript/jQuery** - Event handling and DOM manipulation
• **SCSS/Sass** - Modular styling with theme variations
• **Grunt** - Build automation and task running
• **CSS3** - Transitions and responsive styling
• **Node.js** - Development environment and package management

## Potential Improvements
• **Enhanced browser fallbacks** - Implement manual theme switching for unsupported browsers or add geolocation-based time-of-day detection
• **Extended sensor integration** - Incorporate additional device APIs like orientation, proximity, or battery status for richer adaptive experiences
• **Performance optimization** - Add debouncing for light change events and implement more sophisticated theme transition algorithms

## Commercial Viability
While the Ambient Light API has limited browser support and is considered deprecated in favor of newer sensor APIs, the concept of adaptive interfaces based on environmental conditions remains commercially relevant for accessibility-focused applications and IoT integrations. The project could serve as a foundation for developing more comprehensive adaptive user experience solutions using modern sensor APIs and progressive web app technologies.
